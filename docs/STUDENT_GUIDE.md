## Getting Started

### What is the Degree Planning System?

The Degree Planning System helps you:
- Create and manage your academic plan
- Track progress toward degree completion
- Check which courses you still need
- See course equivalencies between institutions
- Verify prerequisite requirements
- Share your plan with academic advisors

### Accessing the System

1. Open your web browser
2. Navigate to the system URL (provided by your institution)
3. You'll see the home page with options to create a new plan or access an existing one

**Note:** You don't need to create an account - your plans are accessed using unique plan codes.

---

## Creating Your Degree Plan

### Step 1: Start a New Plan

1. Click **"Create New Plan"** on the home page
2. Fill in the required information:
   - **Student Name:** Your full name
   - **Program:** Select your degree program from the dropdown
   - **Transfer Institution:** Select where you're transferring from (if applicable)
   - **Target Institution:** Select where you're transferring to
   - **Starting Semester:** When you plan to start (Fall, Spring, Summer)
   - **Starting Year:** The year you plan to start

3. Click **"Create Plan"**

### Step 2: Save Your Plan Code

After creating your plan, you'll receive a unique **8-character plan code** (e.g., `ABC12345`).

**Important:** Save this code! You'll need it to access your plan later.

**Ways to save your code:**
- Write it down
- Take a screenshot
- Email it to yourself
- Save it in your phone notes
- Bookmark the page

### What Your Plan Includes

Once created, your plan shows:
- All degree requirements for your program
- Credit requirements for each category
- Course options for each requirement
- Your progress toward completion
- Remaining requirements

---

## Adding Courses to Your Plan

### Method 1: Browse Course Options

1. **View your plan** by entering your plan code
2. **Click on any requirement** in your progress tracker
3. **Review course options** listed for that requirement
4. **Click "Add to Plan"** next to any course
5. The course is added to your plan and progress updates automatically

### Method 2: Search for Courses

1. **Click "Add Course"** button
2. **Search by:**
   - Course code (e.g., "BIOS 101")
   - Course title (e.g., "Introduction to Biology")
   - Department (e.g., "BIOS")
3. **Select the course** from search results
4. **Choose which requirement** it fulfills
5. **Click "Add Course"** to confirm

### Understanding Course Cards

Each course in your plan shows:
- **Course Code:** e.g., BIOS 101
- **Course Title:** e.g., Introduction to Biology
- **Credits:** How many credits the course is worth
- **Institution:** Where the course is offered
- **Status Indicators:**
  - Green checkmark: Counts toward your requirements
  - Orange warning: Has a constraint violation
  - Red indicator: Missing prerequisites

### Adding Equivalent Courses

If you're transferring credits:

1. **Find the equivalent course** in the course options
2. **Look for the institution** you attended
3. **Add the equivalent course** to your plan
4. The system recognizes equivalencies and counts them toward your degree

**Example:** If you took "CALC 1" at your previous school and it's equivalent to "MATH 151" at your target school, adding either course will satisfy the requirement.

---

## Tracking Your Progress

### Progress Overview

The main progress tracker shows:
- **Color-coded bars** for each requirement category
- **Percentage complete** for each requirement
- **Credits completed** vs. credits required
- **Visual indicators** for satisfied vs. unsatisfied requirements

### Understanding Progress Bars

**Green sections:** Requirements you've satisfied  
**Gray sections:** Requirements still needed  
**Numbers on bars:** Credits completed / Credits required

### Viewing Requirement Details

Click any progress bar to see:
- **Course options** for that requirement
- **Courses you've added** to your plan
- **Constraint status** (if applicable)
- **Remaining courses** needed
- **Suggested courses** based on prerequisites

### Constraint Status

Some requirements have special rules (constraints):
- **Credit minimums/maximums:** "Need 10-15 credits"
- **Course count requirements:** "Must take 3-5 courses"
- **Level requirements:** "Need 2 upper-level courses"
- **Attribute requirements:** "Need 2 lab courses"

**Constraint indicators:**
- Green checkmark: Constraint satisfied
- Red warning: Constraint not yet satisfied
- Orange course background: Course violates a constraint

### Courses That Violate Constraints

If you add a course that violates a constraint:
- The course appears with an **orange background**
- A **warning icon** shows next to the course
- The **violation reason** is displayed
- **Credits don't count** toward the requirement total

You can still keep the course in your plan, but you'll need to add additional courses that satisfy the constraint.

---

## Understanding Prerequisites

### What Are Prerequisites?

Prerequisites are courses you must complete before taking another course.

**Example:** You must complete Calculus I before taking Calculus II.

### Checking Prerequisites

The system automatically checks prerequisites:
- **Green indicator:** You can take this course
- **Red indicator:** Missing prerequisites
- **Hover or click** to see which prerequisites are missing

### How Prerequisites Work with Equivalencies

The system recognizes equivalent courses for prerequisites.

**Example:**
- Target school requires "MATH 151" as a prerequisite
- You completed "CALC 1" at your previous school
- "CALC 1" = "MATH 151" (equivalent)
- Your prerequisite is satisfied

### Suggested Next Courses

The system suggests courses you can take based on:
- Prerequisites you've already completed
- Courses that fit your remaining requirements
- Constraint requirements (level, credits, etc.)

---

## Understanding Constraints

### What Are Constraints?

Constraints are special requirements beyond just completing courses:

### Credit Constraints

**Example:** "Must complete 10-15 credits from biology electives"

The system:
- Tracks total credits from courses in this category
- Shows how many more credits you need
- Warns if you exceed the maximum

### Course Count Constraints

**Example:** "Must take 3-5 courses from this list"

The system:
- Counts how many courses you've added
- Shows if you need more courses
- Warns if you exceed the maximum

### Level Constraints

**Example:** "Must take at least 2 courses at 3000-level or higher"

The system:
- Identifies which courses are upper-level
- Counts courses at the required level
- Only suggests courses that meet the level requirement

**Course levels:**
- 1000-1999: First-year courses
- 2000-2999: Second-year courses
- 3000-3999: Third-year courses (upper-level)
- 4000-4999: Fourth-year courses (upper-level)

### Attribute Constraints

**Example:** "Must take at least 2 courses with labs"

The system:
- Identifies courses with the required attribute
- Counts courses that meet the requirement
- Filters suggestions to show qualifying courses

---

## Working with Course Equivalencies

### What Are Equivalencies?

Equivalencies show which courses at different institutions are considered equal.

**Example:** "BIOS 101" at one school = "BIO 1010" at another school

### Viewing Equivalencies

1. **Search for a course** using the search feature
2. **Click on the course** to view details
3. **See equivalent courses** listed for other institutions

### Why Equivalencies Matter

- **Transfer credits:** Courses you've taken count toward your new degree
- **Flexibility:** Take courses at different institutions
- **Prerequisites:** Equivalent courses satisfy prerequisites
- **Planning:** See all your options for each requirement

### Using Equivalencies in Your Plan

When adding courses:
1. Look for courses from your transfer institution
2. The system automatically recognizes equivalencies
3. Your progress updates correctly even with equivalent courses

---

## Saving and Sharing Your Plan
